1. import unittest and the function you want to test: 
for example: 
	import unittest
	from name_function import get_formatted_name


2. make a testcase class to inherit from unittest.TestCase
for example:
	class NamesTestCase(unittest.TestCase):


3. write several methods to check each aspect of performance
	and the method which start with    test_   will 	automatically run when we run this  ***.py




4. in the method, we may need to use the function like assert.


5. add unittest.main() in the bottom
	this will tell python to run all the test when this  ***.py runs
