Recursion needs imagination.

The first step: Function return what? (any reasonable idea lead to a useable return)

The second step: Simplify the problem by one step. (make it closer to reach the final solution)

The third step: what if this function reached the final step? It will then use the base case.
		what if it haven't reached the final step? Try to decrease its scale.
