## aim: transfer other data type to int type
## aim2: identify number in 16 base, 8 base and in 2 base. then convert them into 10 base

int(target, base) 

int('010101', 2)
>>> 21


int('aa', 16)
>>>170


## 32 bit int
## the first bit is sign, in whick 0 is positive

## the maximun is int('01111111111111111111111111111111' , base = 2) == 2147483647

## the minimum is int('10000000000000000000000000000000' , base = 2) == 2147483648
