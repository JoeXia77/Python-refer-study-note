three ways to copy:
1.  a= b

2. a = b.copy()

3. 
import copy 
a = copy.deepcopy(b) 

difference:
a = b : a, b reference to the same element
a = b.copy() : a get all the first layer element in b, but only reference elements in the first layer
a = copy.deepcopy(b): a and b are totally disconnected 

deepcopy is useful in complex data format
import copy
newList = copy.deepcopy(oldList)
