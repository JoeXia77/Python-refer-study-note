Aim: convert list to a string

1. just put together, do nothing else:

connector = ''
targetList = ('I','like','to','eat','apple')
print( connector.join(targetList) )

>>>Iliketoeatapple

2. put an space in each element

## connector should be modified
connector = ' '

targetList = ('I','like','to','eat','apple')
print( connector.join(targetList) )

>>>I like to eat apple


3. change to have another connector

connector = '_'

targetList = ('I','like','to','eat','apple')
print( connector.join(targetList) )

>>>I_like_to_eat_apple
