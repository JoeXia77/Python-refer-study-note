## you have a list of numbers and if you want to compare all the numbers for once, but not compare to itself:
## for i in allNumber:
##     compare i with numbers before i
## in this case: i will actively compare all the number before it and passively be compared by all the number after that


example:

Question: 219. Contains Duplicate II
Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

	Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
	Output: true

Solution:
class Solution:
    def containsNearbyDuplicate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        if nums == []:
            return False
        
        L = len(nums)
        table = {nums[0]:0}
        for i in range(1,L):
            if nums[i] in table and i - table[nums[i]] <= k:
                return True
            table[nums[i]] = i
        return False
