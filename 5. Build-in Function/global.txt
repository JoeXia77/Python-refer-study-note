在function内部修改在函数外的变量，需在函数内先声明 global variable
if you use golbal inside a function, this global will make this variable link to the main function's variable 

x = 3
def func():
　　global x
　　x = 2
func()
运行这个函数后: x == 2

## if you are using nested functions, like:
def outer():
	x = 3
	nums = []
	
	def inner():

## the inner will read values in its outer function, but it cannot change a value:
## you cannot use x = 2 in the inner function
## but you can use nums.append(1) to change nums, because nums is a address and this address isn't changed. (but its content changed)
