Aim: generate a featured list
method: List1 = [elementExpression for element in range(start,end,step)]

Example:
squares = [value**2 for value in range(1,11)]
print(squares)



## when I don't want some element exist in a list, I remove those element from the list 
l1 = [2,3,4,5]
l2 = [3,4]
l3 = [x for x in l1 if x not in l2]
--> l3 == [2,5]
## l3 = [x(the target element's name is x) 
	for (some condition, like x in range(5), like x in list3)
	if (another condition, like x not in some list)  ]
