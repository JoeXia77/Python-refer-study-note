## match --- re.match(pattern, string)



## regular experssion:
## if we want to find 'In'
## 1. write some known chars: pattern = 'In'
## if we know some thing could surrounding 'In'
## 2. use "." to stand for any char
##     use "*" to stand for repeating 0 or more times
##     use "+" to stand for repeating 1 or more times
##     so, pattern = '.*In.*'
